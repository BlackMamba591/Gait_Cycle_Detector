# Gait_Cycle_Detector
An Algorithm to detect 6 phases of gait cycle from a walk data




A gait cycle is the sequence of events that a person's feet go through during walking, which together make up a stride. Knowing which phase of the gait cycle the user is in at any given moment can be useful for many wearables. By collecting and classifying accelerometer and gyroscope data of one of the user's feet, we can derive this information.

Summary

This is a real-time algorithm that classifies accelerometer and gyroscope data to identify the current phase of the user's gait cycle
All 6 phases of the classic gait cycle can be identified
The algorithm assumes IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) is placed on the bridge of the right foot
